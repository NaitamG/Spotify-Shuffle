### Summary
For this project I used the AWS Cloud9 IDE to set up and edit all of my code. This IDE allowed me to preview and use the browser extention to view the progress of my application and make the necessary changes. It also allowed me to create my local repository and link it with the remote Github repository. The main backend portion of this app was coded in Python using dependencies such as Flask and requests. The main source of my data is attained using the spotify top-tracks API. I used GET requests to query the data that I needed to display on the website. The website was created using HTML/CSS and was deployed using Heroku.

### Technical issues faced
+ Being able to understand the spotify API and be able to gather the data that I wanted was a big initial struggle and many of my initial queries attempts failed in this process.
+ I had problems with the cloud9 IDE, since it was my first time using this environment, I was unable to figure out a solution to the website previews. There were many times where I'd change something in the code, but the website would not update the changes I made, and it was hard the judge if it was my code or the IDE. Eventually, many students came across this issue and I started using the ctrl+shift+R method to refresh the website everytime I changed somthing, and this gave me an instant feedback and I was able to debug/fix my code efficiently.

### Known problem
+ The data being fetched in only from the top-tracks list, so it's limited to only few options.

### What would you do to improve your project in the future? 
+ I want to add a home page which will have 8 artists profile options
+ I want to add the ability to search any songs on those artists
